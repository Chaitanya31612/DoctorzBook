# DoctorzBook

DoctorzBook is a real-time appointments booking application where user can book appointments with doctors from the convenience of their homes. This application provides user with a very intuitive user experience and try to make appointments process as easy as it can get.

The Pandemic has revealed a clear gap between the patient and the doctor. To fill that void, we present Doctorzbook, a service that allows you to schedule appointments with doctors at your convenience.

This is a project that is built as a part of Veersa Technologies Hackathon competition with aim of Transforming Healthcare through technology innovation. The submission is made by students of Deenbandhu Chottu Ram University of Science and Technology, Murthal(Sonipat), Haryana.
Doctors are lifesavers and that is why they shouldn't be too far from those who need healthcare. With more and more people having the need to seek medical attention, doctors need to make their services accessible and available to their patients. In this time and age where everything and anything can be found on the internet, we need to take advantage of the digital tools/ channels to enable quick scheduling of appointments.


## Inspiration
We all know that during pandamic that happened, we lost many lives just because of lack of communication between doctors and patients. Patients were in need of hospital beds or facilities but couldn't find it primarily because of lack of resources but also because there was no such system where user can find places where slots are free for them. This could have saved them from going from one hospital to other in search of beds.
So with our project DoctorzBook it's one of our initiative to help the society and save lives.

## What it Does
Our project DoctorzBook is an online real-time appointment booking application where user can book an appointment with doctors from the convenience of their homes. This project can act as live saver in times like pandamic where going from hospital to hospital is not suitable nor safe for the patients and other people.

Our project's main motive is to make appointment process as easy as it can get. It provides user with simple interface where they can find nearest doctors and book appointment within seconds.
Primary Services of our application includes:-
### 1. Easy Bookings
Find availability of all doctor and book an appointment.
### 2. Find Doctors Nearby
Ability to find doctors near your location with doctors list sorted basis the distance
### 3. Real-time bookings
There shall not be any conflicting consultation for the doctors/patients at the booked time slots.


## How we built it
In order to build any application or software first we need to understand what the project want from us. So we first analysed the problem statement then in our group discussion we all proposed some ideas out of which some were rejected while others were brainstormed upon. 
Before getting in coding we made wireframes for how our site should look and how our API structure and database schemas should look like. This visual representation enabled us to understand exactly what is happening and how we are going to achieve it.
Then gradually we moved forward and piece by piece developed the application.
The application is built using MERN stack and have used best coding practices and code structure which are prevelent in software industry.
While building the application, we tested it thoroughly like we checked whether each page is behaving properly and we tested each test case that we made, we also have tested all API's using Postman.

### Built With

* React.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Node.js 
* Redux
* SCSS
* Figma/Adobe Xd


## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we took part in this initiative and got to know how technology can save lives if used in the right place at right time.
Saving lives is the best Accomplishment in the world and we are all proud that we have taken initiative regarding the issue.
We have implemented all the required features which are essential to this application and we are extremely proud of it and hope it reaches forward.

## What we learned
We learnt a very essential thing which is how to prioritise work and complete given task in short adequate time through determination and team work. We learnt that there is always scope for more improvements and that it depends on us what vision we have in our minds.
This hackathon organised by Veersa proved very beneficial for all of us and we thank Veersa for providing this opportunity.
The main attributes of learning includes time management, cooperation, prioritization of work, determination and hard work.
